            I've sent him the assignment we discussed recently, he is coming
            back to us this week. Regarding to our last call, I really enjoyed
            talking to him and so far he has the profile we are looking for.
            Can't wait to see his technical test, I'll keep you posted and we'll
            debrief it all together! ðŸ˜Š
